I am currently a research scientist at PROFACTOR working at the interface of computer vision and robotics. My focus is on probabilistic approaches to create self-optimized artificial training data. 

I received my doctoral degree (with distinction) from JKU in the field of computer vision and machine learning.
Recently, I created a widely used real-time 3D reconstruction software called [ReconstructMe](https://www.reconstructme.net/) and initiated several popular [open source projects](https://github.com/cheind).
